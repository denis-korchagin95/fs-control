# Concepts

The configuration based on simple tree things: groups, bindings, and rules.

### Groups

Just some semantic name; It may be a name of the part of your project, for example.
In DDD people operate a layer terms or something like that.

### Bindings

The binding path where located the target elements from one of a group that you specify.
If you are familiar with a Unix-based system, you can think about like "mount point" term.

### Rules

Describes the target elements (directories with semantic meaning) whether in which group the element can be placed


You can write the [configuration](./config_reference.md)
incrementally by set at least one group and at least one binding.

After that, you can [run the tool](./usage.md) and adjust your config step by step.
